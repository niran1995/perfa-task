Files Included:

index.html – Main webpage structure
style.css – Styling and responsiveness
script.js – Basic cart functionality using JavaScript
ecommerce_answers.txt – Short answers for the database and eCommerce understanding
/images – Folder containing product images and web page images

Key Features:
Clean, responsive design
Hero section with "Pre-order Now" button
Features highlighting product benefits
Simple image gallery
Simple products view
Shopping cart with Add/Remove/Update logic and live total calculation
Non-functional contact form layout
Footer with branding and fake social links

Notes:
Cart functionality is handled fully on the frontend with JavaScript and arrays (no backend or database).
Contact form is layout-only and not connected to any backend service.
